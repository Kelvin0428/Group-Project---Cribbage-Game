# Group Project - Cribbage Game
This is a group project i worked on with a fellow classmate during my studies in the University of Melbourne for the subject Softare modelling and design.
## Background
We were given a configurable, running version of a cribbage game trainer, but it does not provide any scoring, or log the run sessions. Our objective was to add these functionality accoridng to the set rules of the Cribbage game.
<br/> We were also required to implement object oriented principles when adding these functionalities. Our analysis of our design is explained in the DesignAnalysis pdf.
